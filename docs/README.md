# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management framework is designed to support consistent and transparent delivery of cross-functional product initiatives. At its core, the approach is customer-centric, iterative, and data-informed. The process begins with project initiation, where business needs are validated, stakeholders are aligned, and success metrics are established through tools like the Project One-pager and stakeholder communication plans. As work progresses, planning activities break the initiative into actionable, prioritized backlogs, clarify acceptance criteria, estimate effort, and map milestones using structured templates and checklists.

## Key Personas

Key personas in OctoAcme's workflows include:

- **Project Managers**: Coordinate delivery and risks across the project lifecycle
- **Product Managers**: Define outcomes and priorities, ensuring alignment with business goals
- **Developers**: Responsible for implementation and testing of features
- **QA or Testing Roles**: Validate completed work against acceptance criteria and quality standards

Clear role definitions ensure accountability and facilitate collaboration throughout the project lifecycle, which spans five primary stages: initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective/continuous improvement. Each phase emphasizes its own deliverables and responsibilities, supported by artifacts like risk registers, roadmaps, and retrospective notes.

## Communication Practices

Communication is a foundational element in OctoAcme's processes, with scheduled cadences for standups, delivery syncs, and stakeholder updates. Weekly syncs between Project and Product Managers, twice-weekly team standups, and regular demos foster alignment and visibility. Stakeholder groups receive milestone-based updates, and clear escalation paths for risks and blockers—from daily triage to sponsor-level involvement—are established to maintain momentum and transparency. Incident and risk management protocols, including templates for weekly status and incident communications, further reinforce clarity and responsiveness.

## Testing and Release Standards

To promote quality and reliability, OctoAcme enforces comprehensive testing and release standards. Pull requests must reference linked issues and acceptance criteria, pass automated CI and security scans, and undergo review before merging. Unit, integration, and end-to-end smoke tests are required during development and pre-release, with manual QA sessions confirming feature acceptance.

## Continuous Improvement

After major milestones, retrospectives capture lessons learned and drive continuous improvement by translating feedback into actionable tasks, ensuring that the process evolves with team insights and changing project realities.
